## Abstract
Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of DOTA-conjugated monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric [Tyr(3)]octreotide-based analogues as a tool for tumor imaging and/or radionuclide therapy. These compounds were synthesized using a Cu(I)-catalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition ("click" reaction) between peptidic azides and dendrimer-derived alkynes and a subsequent metal-free introduction of DOTA via the thio acid/sulfonyl azide amidation ("sulfo-click" reaction). In a competitive binding assay using rat pancreatic AR42J tumor cells, the monomeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide conjugate displayed the highest binding affinity (IC(50) = 1.32 nM) followed by dimeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide (2.45 nM), [DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide (2.45 nM), and tetrameric [Tyr(3)]octreotide (14.0 nM). Biodistribution studies with BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous AR42J tumors showed that the (111)In-labeled monomeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide conjugate had the highest tumor uptake (42.3 +/- 2.8 %ID/g) at 2 h p.i., which was better than [(111)In-DOTA(0),Tyr(3)]octreotide (19.5 +/- 4.8 %ID/g). The (111)In-labeled dimeric [Tyr(3)]octreotide conjugate showed a long tumor retention (25.3 +/- 5.9 %ID/g at 2 h p.i. and 12.1 +/- 1.3 %ID/g at 24 h p.i.). These promising results can be exploited for therapeutic applications.
